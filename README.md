# 👋 Hey, I'm a developer 🏗 — DeFi enthusiast & crypto investor ₿

🏗 **Backend Developer** (Python) with a deep interest in **Web3, DeFi and blockchain data**.  
💻 Building open-source tools to collect and analyze on-chain data from DeFi protocols.  
📜 Currently expanding into **Solidity** and **smart contract development**, with strong fundamentals in blockchain systems.

### 🧩 What I do

- 🐍 **Backend engineering** — FastAPI, asyncio, data pipelines, APIs, and automation.  
- 🪙 **DeFi data** — indexing, analytics, and integrations with on-chain protocols.  
- ⚙️ **Smart contracts** — learning Solidity and Cairo, exploring on-chain automation and vault strategies.  
- 🧾 **Blockchain fundamentals** — cryptography, consensus, tokenomics, and architecture.
